-1) Configure gmail auth and follow the directions the bot prompts you

-2) Go into edit settings and make sure to set everything to your info 
(The sms apis the bot uses is: https://smspva.com/ and https://www.textverified.com/, make sure to load a balance and get your api key to input to the bot)
(For textverified.com, make sure to use your "Simple Access Token" api key)

-3) SMS Price max is set at 1.0 for default, the price max is just set for what you want to pay max for each number (DEPRICATED; price max is hardcoded due to issues)

-4) Discord webhook is optional but very much reccomended to be able to store your new account logins

-5) When entering catchall just enter like this: test.com (do not include the @)

other:

Gmail config removed, will need to configure your own and put in credentials.json

textverified is significantly faster than smspva but costs .25 more per sms at the moment so if you need speed i would 100% go with that, but otherwise
I would just use smspva

Feel free to ask any questions :)
